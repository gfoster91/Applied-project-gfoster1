Gillian Foster
• a summary of the program
We used the framework glfw, we used the guided project runner and substituted the GLUT functions for glfw functions. 
Although, many of the functions were similar, there were a few bugs that were difficult to fix. The timing of the runner is 
much quicker using glfw.
•The type of machine the program has been run on
The program was run on a Windows processor.
• any installations needed
Need to download and install GLFW
